    After Ivan created the login system, we decided that we needed to understand the code before we moved on.
    While we could have not used libraries and flask objects, Ivan stressed that it's what's used in the real
    world so we decided it'd be a good learning experience for all of us, as long as we took the time
    to understand it. After talking to Mykolyk, we also started making a QAF post.
