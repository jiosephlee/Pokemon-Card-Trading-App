    We all started working on the design doc. Ivan mainly handled the diagrams
    for the back-end, I worked on the site map and task division, Eric worked on
    the component map, and Amanda handled the description features of the design
    doc and helped wherever possible.

ivanG -- 2019-11-17 14:22
    Created gitignore
    Reworked structure to the app
    Added base template

josephL -- 2019-11-17 18:41
    Being relatively finished with the design doc, Ivan requested access to
    start the login system and I gave him permission as it's necessary for any
    kind of website.

ivanG -- 2019-11-17 20:42
    Added ORM
    Created login and signup pages/processes
    Added login management
    Added flash support
    Added breadcrumbs

josephL -- 2019-11-19 08:10
    After Ivan created the login system, we decided that we needed to understand
    the code before we moved on. While we could have not used libraries and
    flask objects, Ivan stressed that it's what's used in the real world so we
    decided it'd be a good learning experience for all of us, as long as we took
    the time to understand it. After talking to MR.Mykolyk, we made a QAF post
    about it.

ivanG -- 2019-11-19 08:29
    Added another table to the database. Will start working on more tables and
    relationships soon.

josephL -- 2019-11-19 08:35
    Updated design doc with front-end framework clarification and updated APIs

josephL -- 2019-11-19 17:35
    Contacted team and divided short term tasks which would be done by the night
    of 11-20.
      - Eric would finish the API card for pokemon cards and start on the back-
        end for trading
      - Ivan would finish the back-end for initializing cards and selling them
      - Amanda would work on showing owned cards and money accordingly to the
        currency of the user's location
    We also decided that it'd be best if I learned SQLAlchemy and made a QAF
    post, since Ivan already knew how it works. However, Ivan accordingly add to
    and review the post before I posted it.

josephL -- 2019-11-19 22:10
    After reading many articles, I finished writing up the QAF post for
    SQLAlchemy on a google doc. I then shared the doc to Ivan to confirm/add
    anything. He cleaned up the code, I asked him a few questions, and then
    posted on the QAF.

amandaC -- 2019-11-19 23:34

    Read the ego reading together through a discord call and wrote some actions
    we could take

ericL -- 2019-11-20 22:50
    Protocols to make more awesome:
    1. Share and explain our code to each other to facilitate collaborative
    programming.
    2. Request assistance and/or explanations as needed, first from each other
    then from external sources (crediting as necessary).

josephL -- 2019-11-20 23:14
    3. Working together in person: We have planned to meet in the CSDojo
    tomorrow, and plan to work in Discord calls more often.

ivanG -- 2019-11-21 08:09

    Integrated the exchange rates API into the project which includes:
    Functions that interact with the API endpoint
    Functions that store exchange rates and automatically update them
    Functinality to store the user's currency in the session
    Client-side javascript to update the user's currency and update the displayed currency on the client without having to contact the server. Interestingly, this ends up causing weird conversion errors because floating point division. So, we might want to fix that later.
