    We all started working on the design doc. Ivan mainly handled the diagrams
    for the back-end, I worked on the site map and task division, Eric worked on
    the component map, and Amanda handled the description features of the design
    doc and helped wherever possible.

    Created gitignore
    Reworked structure to the app
    Added base template

    Being relatively finished with the design doc, Ivan requested access to
    start the login system and I gave him permission as it's necessary for any
    kind of website.

    Added ORM
    Created login and signup pages/processes
    Added login management
    Added flash support
    Added breadcrumbs

    After Ivan created the login system, we decided that we needed to understand
    the code before we moved on. While we could have not used libraries and
    flask objects, Ivan stressed that it's what's used in the real world so we
    decided it'd be a good learning experience for all of us, as long as we took
    the time to understand it. After talking to MR.Mykolyk, we made a QAF post
    about it.

    Added another table to the database. Will start working on more tables and
    relationships soon.

leeJo -- 2019-11-19 08:35
    Updated design doc with front-end framework clarification and updated APIs

leeJo -- 2019-11-19 17:35
    Contacted team and divided short term tasks which would be done by the night
    of 11-20.
      - Eric would finish the API card for pokemon cards and start on the back-
        end for trading
      - Ivan would finish the back-end for initializing cards and selling them
      - Amanda would work on showing owned cards and money accordingly to the
        currency of the user's location
    We also decided that it'd be best if I learned SQLAlchemy and made a QAF
    post, since Ivan already knew how it works. However, Ivan accordingly add to
    and review the post before I posted it.

leeJo -- 2019-11-19 22:10
    After reading many articles, I finished writing up the QAF post for
    SQLAlchemy on a google doc. I then shared the doc to Ivan to confirm/add
    anything. He cleaned up the code, I asked him a few questions, and then
    posted on the QAF.

    Changed log in and sign up to buttons and removed welcome item after user
    logs in.

    Grouped up with team members and re-assigned short term tasks, re-clarified structure
    and flow of the website -> update design doc.
    Read the ego reading together through a discord call and wrote some actions
    we could take

josephL -- 2019-11-20 22:35
    the environment is crucial for successful communication; establishing an environment where everyone throws
    out their bias of other group members and where everyone is equal is key to a communicative and learning
    experience. We realize that Ivan comes with a lot of knowledge and experience and so this kind of creates
    a power dynamic that's hard to throw out. One thing we're going to strive for is working together in person.
    Working in person makes asking questions and talking a lot more natural. And talking about the project helps
    us understand each other's thought processes, which in turns helps us trust each other more.
    Thus, we have planned to meet in the CSDojo tomorrow, and plan to work in Discord calls more often.
